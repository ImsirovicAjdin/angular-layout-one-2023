  <h3>Recruitment - International Nursing Recruitment</h3>

  <div>
    <!-- advantages -->
    <h4>What advantages do foreign skilled workers offer?</h4>

    <p>
      The employment of international specialists enhances the global image,
      expands the network and develops international relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      The business model is of course not new in essence - neither the
      international recruitment of nursing staff, nor the permanent placement
      itself. What should be new, however, is the way of implementation and the
      quality path that we want to take for both customers and applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the heading "Working, learning and living in Germany" we place the
      applicant or candidate at the center of our efforts. With this conceptual
      approach, we aim to invite motivated, medically and nursingly trained
      specialists from abroad within the framework of the freedom of movement
      for workers, but also from third countries to Germany, to put them into
      qualified service here in cooperation with customers, to support them in
      obtaining their professional recognition to support all levels and to
      develop further at the highest possible professional level. These
      specialists should be permanently bound to our customers and our
      healthcare system through our distinct welcoming culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      The search for qualified specialists takes time and ties up human
      resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our task is not only to bring you together with the right candidates, but
      above all to prepare and accompany them for the process of integration
      into the new environment. This ensures a higher success rate and ensures
      the sustainability of your staffing.
    </p>

    <h4>Our service process for you</h4>
    <p>
      We take care of the pre-selection of candidates who have a qualification
      that makes professional recognition possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      All applicants have passed our screening. Our aim is to meet the needs of
      our customers with transparency, empathy and professionalism and to
      accompany the specialists on their way to a new life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We organize the interview (by phone/Skype and in person) as well as the
      transfer of the candidates to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest challenge is the language requirements. We have our own
      language coaches who specifically prepare our candidates for a B1 or B2
      level (technical language).
    </p>

    <p>
      As standard, we take care of all written and administrative matters from
      the preparation of the CV, the submission of applications, the (certified)
      translation of the documents for the recognition of degrees etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      We personally advise each candidate throughout the process and report on
      it. If desired, we carry out intercultural training for integration in
      Germany or special technical language training.

  <h3>
    HR Consulting - We increase your attractiveness as an employer and
    rationalize your duty scheduling!
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p>We work closely together in consulting projects:</p>

    <p>
      The Netherlands are 20 years ahead of Germany when it comes to making
      working hours more flexible in the healthcare sector. We - the consulting
      firm Noteboom & Van der Meulen and Eggert Kleffmann & Partner - use this
      advantage for you and thus accelerate your learning curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Employer-oriented flexibility dominates in Germany. Flexibility exists
      primarily as a control tool for corporate management. A conservative
      attitude often prevails in the organization of working hours in the care
      and health sector.
    </p>

    <p>
      In an international comparison, the Netherlands has a high degree of
      employee-oriented working time flexibility. That means: in the
      Netherlands, the flexibilization of working hours primarily serves the
      interests of the employees.
    </p>

    <p>
      In view of the inevitable worsening of the shortage of skilled workers, it
      is advisable for HR managers and nursing directors in Germany to look at
      developments in the Netherlands and to be open to new ideas and approaches
      for systemic flexibility and absence management.
    </p>

    <p>
      We would be happy to tell you more about the flexibility concept in a
      personal conversation and how Noteboom & Van der Meulen has already
      introduced it to German hospitals and companies that care for the elderly!
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, we want to make our knowledge, our skills and our network
      available to everyone involved in order to bring about improvements in the
      system, in the organization and in intercultural cooperation.
