<h2>ABOUT US</h2>

<div>
  <div>
    <p>
      Eggert Kleffmann & Partner GmbH is an internationally and interculturally
      oriented personnel consulting company. We work virtually, flexibly and
      needs-based - in terms of time and expertise.
    </p>

    <p>
      We specifically support clinics and hospitals in the area of ​​recruiting
      and integrating nursing staff, midwives and doctors - both from the EU and
      from third countries. In order to become more efficient, we are constantly
      working on our international infrastructure. Good advice and support for
      our candidates is just as important to us as their language development,
      which is one of the most obvious quality criteria for our customers.
      Therefore, on the one hand, we depend on good employers for our candidates
      and, on the other hand, we expect the candidates to take development
      initiatives themselves. For language acquisition, we provide individually
      tailored training courses via our
      <a href="#">Hello-Nurse onlineAcademy</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For us, the process of placement is complete when our candidate, as an
      employee of our customer, has received his professional license as a
      specialist.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, we are interested in other "pain therapies" for our
      customers that arise in connection with the shortage of skilled workers.
      In this context, we work as active consultants on projects to improve
      outage management and the establishment of FlexTeams in hospitals. The
      goal pursued for nursing staff is called <a href="#">"free is free"</a>.
